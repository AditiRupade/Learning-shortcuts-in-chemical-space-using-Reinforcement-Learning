    "In this notebook, we have trained a reinforcement learning model for a closed maze. The closed maze is imagined like a sphere. For example, if we reach end of first row of the maze and we are moving up, the agent should reach end of the bottom row. A fun way of imagining a maze and seeing whether the agent learns this structure."
